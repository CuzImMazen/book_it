Book It – House Rental App

Book It is a Flutter mobile application for renting and managing houses. Users can browse properties, make bookings, rate and favorite properties. Property owners can list and manage their properties, and approve or modify booking requests.

The app works with a Laravel backend API (not included) to handle listings, users, and bookings.

⚠️ Work in Progress: Some features may be incomplete or require backend setup for full functionality.
